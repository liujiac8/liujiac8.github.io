Jiachen Liu, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral research associate in the Wedow Lab and under the Department of Statistics at Purdue University. She received her Ph.D. in Measurement and Quantitative Methods and M.S. in Statistics from Michigan State University. And she received her B.S. in Statistics from Beijing Normal University.

Jiachen is particularly interested in socio-genomic problems. In the Wedow Lab, she works on developing and applying statistical methods for multi-ancestry polygenic risk score and fine-mapping using large-scale datasets such as UK Biobank and All of US. She is also interested in exploring approaches to studying nonlinear Mendelian randomization problems. Methodologically, she is broadly interested in Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), variable selection, and causal inference analysis. This site highlights her research, teaching, and academic presentations.
